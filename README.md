# Labour Market Indicators RSA

I want to create a semi automated dashboard looking at labour market indicators in South Africa

My current workflow is to manually update some nice figures in an excel sheet, and I think I can do better.

Interactivity would be nice - but I don't think a shiny app is required. Just a static HTML page with some interactivity will suffice. 

## Process

I need to work out how to take a spreadsheet and ingenst it automatically to update the figures.

I need to make the figures.

I need to decide on the kinds of indicators that are important.

### What do I want to include?

- Employment
- Earnings
- Unemployment
- Skill composition
- Maybe something from LinkedIn data about the number of job postings in SA in different industries? Could do a nice scraping exercise here, looking at different key words like "python" and "CFA".
